# mock-blog
This is a mock blog website created using JavaScript and HTML. It contains a visually enhanced main review page, two sample article pages, and an "about the author" page which you can access using the navigation bar
and return to the home screen using the bouncing arrow (special thanks to codepen.io for the arrow .css!). As you can see, the website is fully responsive and can be viewed on all devices such as iPads, smartphones,
laptops, as well as full desktop 1920x1080 displays. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me!
